# GCTSAAS

This repository contains the initial scaffolding for the **Grounded Coherence Theory** SaaS platform. The project aims to deliver exportable programs for industry customers to assess and improve organizational coherence.

## Overview

The `src/components/GCTArchitecture.tsx` file contains a React component that visualizes the proposed architecture of the system. Each component of the SaaS stack can be clicked to reveal implementation details and key considerations.

Future development will expand on this foundation to provide a fully functional platform.
